# What is CI/CD

continuous integration, continuous delivery, and continuous deployment

Continuous integration (CI): 

A software development practice in which developers regularly merge (integrate) their code changes into a central repository, and automated builds and tests are run
This helps catch integration issues early and ensures that the codebase is always in a deployable state.
