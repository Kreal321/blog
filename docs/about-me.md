# The past, present and future

## About Me
I have over 2 year of professional experience as a Backend Java/J2EE Developer and over 7 years of experience in programming with diversified exposure in all the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle using Spring Boot, Spring MVC, Spring AOP, Spring Data, Spring Security, Hibernate ORM, and Microservice as well as other web development technologies including RabbitMQ, WebSockets, WebHooks, OAuth2, Gateway, Feign, Eureka, JUnit, Mockito, docker, HTML/CSS, javascript and so on.


## A little history
I created my personal tech blog to share my experiences, insights, and best practices with others who are interested in technology. As a software developer, I have learned a great deal through my own experiences and by collaborating with others. Through my blog, I hope to give back to the community by sharing what I have learned, and by offering guidance to those who may be just starting out on their own tech journeys. I aim to cover a wide range of topics, including programming languages, frameworks, design patterns, and more. By sharing my knowledge, I hope to inspire others to learn, grow, and achieve their goals in the tech industry. I'm excited to embark on this new journey, and I look forward to engaging with my readers as we explore the world of technology together.
